ByteForge
=========
Computer security education example code.

Starting from zero, you should:

1. Boot a linux distribution, including at least g++ git make

2. Open a terminal, by pressing ctrl-alt-T (for Terminal)

3. Clone this repository, with:

                git clone https://github.com/olawlor/byteforge

Now play with some of the programs:
	* debug060 is an introduction to debugging with gdb
	* server101 is a 32-bit linux server, vulnerable to buffer overflow attack


Remember: with great power, comes great responsibility.
